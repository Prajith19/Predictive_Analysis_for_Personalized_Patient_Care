Project Description:

Welcome to our groundbreaking healthcare initiative designed for comprehensive hospital environments. Our project is dedicated to proactively identifying patients at elevated risk of critical medical conditions during their admission, thereby prioritizing patient well-being, minimizing adverse incidents, and transforming proactive healthcare management.

Utilizing cutting-edge machine learning models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), decision trees, and XG Boost, our primary objective is to pinpoint the optimal algorithm for predicting critical medical conditions. The project involves a meticulous analysis of diverse patient data, including factors such as age, gender, admission type, lifestyle, and medical test results.

Our ultimate goal is to revolutionize patient care by identifying individuals at heightened risk across various disease categories, including cardiovascular diseases, respiratory ailments, neurological disorders, kidney diseases, and metabolic imbalances. By leveraging advanced algorithms, we aim to contribute to refining patient care, optimizing resource allocation, and significantly reducing adverse occurrences within the hospital ecosystem.

But we don't stop there. Our initiative goes beyond prediction. An integrated recommendation system has been expertly incorporated into the project. This system proposes personalized treatments and suitable medications for each patient. This is achieved through the use of VADER sentiment analysis and weighted average ratings calculation, ensuring that treatment recommendations are tailored to each patient's unique needs.

Join us in this transformative journey as we combine the power of machine learning, data analysis, and personalized healthcare recommendations to enhance patient outcomes and shape the future of proactive healthcare management.
