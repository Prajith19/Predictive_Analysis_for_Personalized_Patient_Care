Project Description:

Welcome to our groundbreaking healthcare initiative designed for comprehensive hospital environments. Our project is dedicated to proactively identifying patients at elevated risk of critical medical conditions during their admission, thereby prioritizing patient well-being, minimizing adverse incidents, and transforming proactive healthcare management.

Utilizing cutting-edge machine learning models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), decision trees, and XG Boost, our primary objective is to pinpoint the optimal algorithm for predicting critical medical conditions. The project involves a meticulous analysis of diverse patient data, including factors such as age, gender, admission type, lifestyle, and medical test results.

Our ultimate goal is to revolutionize patient care by identifying individuals at heightened risk across various disease categories, including cardiovascular diseases, respiratory ailments, neurological disorders, kidney diseases, and metabolic imbalances. By leveraging advanced algorithms, we aim to contribute to refining patient care, optimizing resource allocation, and significantly reducing adverse occurrences within the hospital ecosystem.

But we don't stop there. Our initiative goes beyond prediction. An integrated recommendation system has been expertly incorporated into the project. This system proposes personalized treatments and suitable medications for each patient. This is achieved through the use of VADER sentiment analysis and weighted average ratings calculation, ensuring that treatment recommendations are tailored to each patient's unique needs.

Join us in this transformative journey as we combine the power of machine learning, data analysis, and personalized healthcare recommendations to enhance patient outcomes and shape the future of proactive healthcare management.



Project Workflow Explanation:

Model Exploration:
The project encompasses three separate models for disease prediction, each in its own Jupyter Notebook file:
"ANN model.ipynb": Utilizes Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for disease prediction.
"MultiOutput Decision Tree.ipynb": Implements a MultiOutput Decision Tree model.
"XG Boost model.ipynb": Leverages the power of XG Boost for predictive modeling.

Recommendation System Development:
The recommendation system is detailed in the file named "Recommendation System Detailed.ipynb".
This comprehensive system utilizes advanced NLP techniques such as VADER sentiment analysis and weighted average ratings calculation to recommend drugs tailored to specific diseases.

Integration and Final Code:
The heart of the project lies in "Main.py", a Python script that seamlessly combines disease prediction and drug recommendation.
This unified code integrates the optimal disease prediction model and the sophisticated recommendation system.

Data Accessibility:
All necessary datasets for running the codes are conveniently provided in the repository.
Access the datasets for the models ("ANN model.ipynb", "MultiOutput Decision Tree.ipynb", "XG Boost model.ipynb") and the recommendation system ("Recommendation System Detailed.ipynb") within the repository.

Project Documentation:
The project's methodology, research papers, and results are encapsulated in the explanatory PowerPoint presentation titled Project_Explanation.pdf.
Explore the repository to delve into the intricacies of disease prediction, drug recommendation, and the harmonious integration of multiple models, all supported by comprehensive documentation for a thorough understanding of the project's journey.
